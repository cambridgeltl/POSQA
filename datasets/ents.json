  "text": "Some well-known substances, when scaled down to nanoscale size, exhibit new functions and properties that differ from those in their natural state. These substances are generally referred to as nanoparticles. For example, the nanoparticle of gold, or the metal gold (Au) downsized to the nanoscale, emits colors other than gold such as red and black, depending on diameter, thus can be used in applications such as laser-irradiated color markings. In addition, nanoparticles that scatter UV rays are used in cosmetic products, demonstrating the diverse areas of their application."

  "text": "The substance that determines the genetic information of all organisms on the earth. It is well known for its double helix structure, which enables it to replicate itself in order to transmit genetic information. DNA consists of the four bases of adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine, the combination of which defines the appearance and constitution of organisms. A joint team of members from six countries had been engaged in an international cooperative effort to determine the complete sequence of the approximately 3 billion bases, and after roughly 15 years, on April 14, 2003, announced it had successfully mapped the human genome (complete genetic information of humans). This announcement came 50 years after the groundbreaking discovery of the double helix structure of DNA in April of 1953."

  "text": "A cylindrical tube formed by carbons in a netted structure. It is about 1 nanometer thick, with a length several thousand times its thickness. It has a strength about 20 times that of steel, with half the weight of aluminum, and exhibits phenomenal tensile strength in the direction of the fibers. With these traits, it could enable cargo shipments between space and the earth, making it a technical innovation in which interest is growing. It is a 'dream substance,' whose diverse properties -- such as heat resistance to endure 2000 degrees Celsius under specific conditions, or highly efficient heat transmission -- could potentially contribute to resolving our energy problems."

Of these, glutamic acid, which is familiar to us as a synthetic seasoning, was named after the fact that it was isolated by hydrolysis from a protein called gluten found in wheat, by the German, Ritthausen, in 1866. It is a nonessential amino acid which plays an important role as a neurotransmitter in memory and learning."

The hydrogen atom (protium), having the simplest structure of all atoms, is composed of a single electron orbiting a nucleus consisting of a single proton. In 1766, the British chemist/physicist Henry Cavendish became the first in the world to discover hydrogen. Later, the French chemist Lavoisier confirmed the generation of hydrogen from water, and named it the \"hydrogen atom\" based on the Greek words \"hydor (water)\" and \"gennao (generate).\" The word \"atom\" is traced to the Greek word \"atmos (something that can not be divided).\""

It is a well known fact that in electric power generation, atomic energy is generated by splitting the nucleus of substances such as uranium and plutonium. The phenomenon of nuclear fission was discovered in 1938 by a German physicist Otto Hahn, who later received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1944."

It is utilized in nuclear energy-related applications, being a requisite for the activation of the nuclear power reactor. It can also be applied in analyzing the properties of substances, by hitting targets with a neutron beam and observing scattered neutrons. Potentially, it is being considered for other applications such as protein analysis in life sciences, and visualization and inspection of high-technology products in industry. The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the British physicist James Chadwick, who later received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1935."
